By default `libxlsxwriter` holds all cell data in memory. This is to allow
future features where formatting is applied separately from the data.

The effect of this is that for large files libxlsxwriter can consume a lot of
memory.

This issue will be resolved in the next 1-2 releases to allow a small constant
memory usage like in the Perl and Python modules that libxlsxwriter was ported
from.

Next: @ref examples
